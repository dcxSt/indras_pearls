    <p style="font-family:special elite">Brave sailor, you are travelling on the deep dark ocean on a strange planet with bulging orange, green, and purple shapes around the equator. Your bearing is due West-West-West-South-West. Your map is a stereographic projection of the Riemann Sphere rotated by pi over two radians. The north pole is marked in red, the south pole is marked in blue.<p>
    <p style="font-family:special elite">Click on the canvas to spwan circle ships! <br/>Click many a time if it please your fancy.<br/>Click to see them follow their baring,<br/>Click and watch the map you sail.<br/>Then watch the ships sink into the south pole sink.</p>
